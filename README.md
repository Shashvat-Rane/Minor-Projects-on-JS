# Summary

All these projects are fully responsive, and my main goal in implementing them was to practice JavaScript's DOM manipulation while gaining confidence in the language. Throughout these projects, I explored various DOM manipulation methods to deepen my understanding.

Additionally, working on these projects improved my skills in building responsive websites, reinforcing my ability to create user-friendly and adaptable designs.
